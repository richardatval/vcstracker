Quicklists

What is a Quicklist?
--------------------

.. warning:: The Quicklist function is currently in development, in the near future all Quicklist functionality will be in the Quick Search window.

A Quicklist is a way of bringing together a quick list of contacts from multiple groups in order to add an Activity, send a Mailshot or add a Keyword to all of those contacts in one go - rather than having to open multiple group records.

.. note:: When you log out of VCS Tracker your Quicklist is cleared

Making a Quicklist
------------------

Quicklists are created in the Quick Search window using the Contact search function, and are based on individual contacts rather than groups. Start by searching for your first contact remembering to set the Quick search on Contacts.

Showing a Quicklist

At any time you can show the current contacts that are in your Quicklist by using the Show Quicklist button, the results in the Quick search window will change to show your Quicklist contacts. 

When a set of Quicklist contacts is being displayed you can carry out an action by using the Add Activity, Apply Keyword, Mailshot or Export for Mailings buttons.
