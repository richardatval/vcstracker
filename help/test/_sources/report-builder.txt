Report Builder
==============
Using Report Builder
--------------------

VCS Tracker has a powerful built-in reporting system that allows you to create customised reports based on virtually any field within in the database.

Open the Report Builder window by selecting Report Builder from the Reports menu.

Adding fields to your report
----------------------------

You can add up to 60 fields to include in your report, these are selected via the 'Show fields' button on the right side of the window. This will bring up a smaller window from which you can add fields to appear in your report.

.. note:: The fields are grouped together based on the tab they appear on in the Group details window, so for example Group Name and District can be selected from Group Details, and the Beneficiary of Young People can be selected from Beneficiaries.

As tickboxes work on a Yes (ticked) or No (not ticked) basis for easier analysis we save these as Ones and Zeros (1 = Yes (ticked), 0 = No (not ticked)). You can turn this off by un-ticking the 'Replace Y/N Output with 1/0 for Statistical Analysis' tickbox on the main window.

Report Builder Rules
--------------------

Your reports can be for all groups in VCS Tracker, or you can use the Rules boxes to specify your own search criteria for the groups you wish to include.

Like the Ad-hoc Query the Report Builder uses the same ALL and ANY rules boxes to allow you to select groups for your report based on your own criteria. 

Saving the results
------------------

To run your report press the Report button in the bottom corner of the Report Builder window, depending on the required fields and rules generating your report may take a few seconds. A new sheet will appear with the results of your report including the fields you specified.

When you have your results you can use the Save As button to save the data into a CSV file, which can be analysed in more depth using software such as Microsoft Excel.
