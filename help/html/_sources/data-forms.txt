What are Data Forms?
--------------------

Data Forms are an easy way to collect more information about a group, a Data Form can be printed and sent to the group, or emailed so that they can fill in any missing information and return it to you.

There are multiple types of Data Forms, but they are generally broken down into two types: blank Data Forms and filled in Data Forms.

Blank Data Forms
----------------

If you are working with a group who is not currently on VCS Tracker you can print a blank Data Form to take with you or to send ahead before meeting with the group. As the name suggests a blank Data Form contains no information. 

Filled in Data Forms
