What are Keywords?
==================

Keywords have two different uses in VCS Tracker, Keywords can be used to:

* for managing a list of contacts (e.g. subscription to a mailing list)
* for recording and analysing activities around a specific theme of work

Keywords can be added to VCS Tracker by a Superuser.

Keyword groups
--------------

To help keep the Keywords list organised Keyword groups allow you to keep related Keywords together and easy to find. When a Superuser adds a Keyword it can be placed in any Keyword group, for example you may have Keywords for training events, monthly newsletters subscribers and multiple forums. Rather than appearing as a single list of Keywords mixed together these can be assigned to a common Group, such as Training Events, Newsletters and Forums.

A Keyword must be part of a Keyword group before it shows in the Keyword picker.
