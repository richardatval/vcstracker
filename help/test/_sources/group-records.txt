Group Records
=============

VCS Tracker stores multiple pieces of information on groups via the Group Details window, this window is split down into multiple tabs each covering a sub-section of data, you can switch between tabs by clicking on their name.

Group Details tab
-----------------

The Group Details tab has the main contact information about the group, this tab is split in half (highlighted by the purple line). The top half of this tab shows the main contact information and geographical location for where the group is based and the lower half contains basic details about who the group primarily works with, the main service they provide and what type of 'client' they are.

--------------

The activities tab is used to record the work you have carried out with the group, the activity information can be reported and analysed by using the Activity Report function.

Areas tab
---------

The Areas tab is used to record what geographical areas a group works in, in our example we have a sub-tab for each district in Leicestershire, and a sub-tab for Leicester City. Each sub-tab contains tickboxes that can be selected to further record particular sub-areas (such as wards) a group works in.

This information can be used in Ad-Hoc query searches, or in the Report Builder or in an Activity Report for more analysis of where services are being provided.

Contacts tab
------------

The Contacts tab is used to manage the contact for each group, a group can have multiple contacts and each contact can have their own postal address, telephone number, email address, mailing preferences and Keywords. For more information on Keywords and Mailing preferences please see the following sections........ Keywords ....... Mailing Rules

Data tab

The Data tab holds various pieces of information about the group that fits outside of the other tabs, the Data tab includes space to record how many full time and part time staff / volunteers a group has, how many beneficiaries a year they support and other data such as their Charity or Limited Company number and any Group tags.

For more information about Group tags please see the :ref:`what-are-group-tags` page.

Directory tab
-------------

The Directory tab is used for storing public facing contact information about the group, this information can then be exported for use with an online directory website or can be used for printed directories.

   :align: center

Before being included in a Directory the group must supply one method of contact, either postal address, telephone, email or fax and must have a Directory Entry. The 'Include in Directories' tickbox must be selected before the group will be included in a directory. By un-ticking this the group's details will be removed from the directory during the next update.

Directory Categories are used to organise the directory into the main services a group provides, the group should select the Directory Categories they wish to appear under.

.. note:: A limit on how many Directory Categories a group can choose is recommended as this allows the Directory search system to provide better results.
