Mailshots
=========
VCS Tracker can be used to send mailshots directly to multiple groups or contacts, however you can export a list of contacts for your mailshot to be sent out via other software such as Microsoft Outlook or MailChimp. 

Mailshots in VCS Tracker are either a Standard mailshots (which obeys the Mailing Preferences) or Keyword mailshots (which override the mailing preferences).

Both Standard mailshots and Keyword mailshots use the same functions for you to write your mailshot contents or export your recipient list, how you generate your list of recipients determines the type of mailshot you are doing and the mailings rules that will be applied.

Standard mailshots
------------------

Standard mailshots are based an Ad-Hoc query or a Quicklist, if you are using an Ad-Hoc query your mailshot will be sent to the main contact for the groups selected or if you are using a Quicklist it will be sent to the contacts selected.


Keyword mailshots
-----------------

Keyword mailshots they override the standard mailing rules as these are designed to be targeted to a specific area of work or interest.

To generate a list of contacts to use in a Keyword mailshot you use the Quick Search window to find groups and then the Keyword filter to show those contacts for those groups who have the selected Keyword.

To create your mailing list start with the Quick Search function, clear the search box and press the Search button. This will bring up every group in the database. From here you then use the Keyword picker above the results box to start filtering contacts by your chosen Keyword. VCS Tracker will then search the contacts for every group that was listed and if any contacts have that Keyword they will be displayed in the results window.

As there could be thousands of contacts in the database this step may take a few moments, a progress bar shows how things are going.

.. warning:: If you cancel the Keyword filter then the Quick Search window will be returned empty.

After a few moments the progress bar will disappear and you will be left with your mailshot list, there may be duplicate listings of the same group as more than one contact in that group may have the Keyword - each contact will get their own separate copy of the mailshot.

Send Mailshot

Once you have your list of mailshot recipients you can

Export for Mailing
------------------

If you use other software for your mailshots, for example MailChimp, you can use the Export for Mailing option to create a CSV file of the mailing list recipients rather than sending your mailshot out directly
