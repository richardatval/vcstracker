================================
Logging in
----------

* On a PC double click on the VCS Tracker icon on your Desktop, or open VCS Tracker from the Start menu under Programs -> VCS Tracker 
* On a Mac click on the VCS Tracker on your Dock, or open VCS Tracker from the Applications -> VCS Tracker folder

After a few moments the VCS Tracker log in screen should appear - select your name from the User Name dropdown menu, and enter your password. To log in press the Log In button. VCS Tracker will remember the username of the last person who logged in.
